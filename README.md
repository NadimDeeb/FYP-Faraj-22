**FYP-Faraj-22**<br>
-
Final Year Project for our bachelors degree in ECE. It incorporates Augmented Reality using a Hololens2 with robotics.

**-Aim:**<br>

Augmented reality simulation purposes where real and augmented worlds are bridge allowing for a closer assesment of the extra link. More realistic than Gazebo or Unity simulations since you are in the simulation.

**-Features:**<br>
1. Overlay desired augmented link such as robotic arm, lidars and other types of custom augmentations. (Repo only inlucdes robotic arm for show case)
2. Use VKC model on ROS brain to ensure arm overlay moves in the correct direction.
3. Allow Hololens2 wearer to overlay augmented links on top of desired surface using the Vuforia detection model and it's Model Target Generator.
4. Allow Hololens2 wearer remote control of the robot. (In this case a Husky AGV robot)
